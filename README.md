NEWS
====

apk generation for sb2 files is on hold at the moment due to touch events playing up (again!) on the latest Chrome for Android update (it was fine prior to this!). Also signing of the apk will not be possible on the web client (you will need to do this via a 3rd party app). At least I have a sb2 project file autoloading now, with the required js file generating after a file drop.

Updates (tested in Chrome)
--------------------------

Full Sound when wav > 30 secs
SVG Text now working correctly
ColorTouchingColor Block coded
Offline SB file auto loader
Speed optimisation (as fast as Scratch now)
Warp Framework and Turbo mode fully optimised
