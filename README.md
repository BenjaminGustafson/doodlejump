APK_V7 = (V0.325)

NEWS
====

Compiled apk zip projects are now completely offline. This means you can create a scratch game, package and run it on your phone / tablet without occurring any data charges! - good for where there's no internet or data is unavailable. (dessert island?)

Scratch2apk v1 has now been released! Thanks to Dogtopius for the App's logo.

You can now convert a scratch project from the phosphorus++ webpage to an apk to run on your phone / tablet.

apk update:<br>Thank you Yanir Calisar & Monu (@ Stack Overflow) for helping me with the download link issue when creating large apk's!

App to be renamed 'Scratch2apk'

The app's main feature is that it runs completely offline, thus avoiding any unwanted data charges.

I'll be focusing more now on running this emulator from an apk point of view, rather than just a web page. This means I can 'cheat' on some effects and SVG issues as the games will be running on a phone screen :)

apk generation for sb2 files is back on! but signing of the apk will not be possible on the web client (you will need to do this via a 3rd party app). At least I have a sb2 project file autoloading now, with the required js file generating after a file drop.
