App to be renamed 'Scratch2apk'

The app's main feature is that it runs completely offline, thus avoiding any unwanted data charges.

I'll be focusing more now on running this emulator from an apk point of view, rather than just a web page. This means I can 'cheat' on some effects and SVG issues as the games will be running on a phone screen :)

apk generation for sb2 files is back on! but signing of the apk will not be possible on the web client (you will need to do this via a 3rd party app). At least I have a sb2 project file autoloading now, with the required js file generating after a file drop.
