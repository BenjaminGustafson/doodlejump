apk generation for sb2 files is on hold at the moment due to touch events playing up (again!) on the latest Chrome for Android update (it was fine prior to this!). Also signing of the apk will not be possible on the web client (you will need to do this via a 3rd party app). At least I have a sb2 project file autoloading now, with the required js file generating after a file drop.
